#### [ Description ] : These vulnerabilities source the payload from a component of the address bar, usually the fragment, and use javascript sinks to trigger DOM based XSS.


#### [ Location.hash ]
 
#### 1.Location.hash - setTimeout
#### 2.Vulnerable Code : 
 <script>
      var payload = window.location.hash.substr(1);setTimeout('var a=a;' + payload, 1); 
 </script>
#### 3: source : window.location.hash.substr(1) 
//This source extracts the fragments part from the URL and store as payload variable(The portion after the # sign):


####  sink   :  setTimeout('var a=a;' + payload, 1); 
// The setTimeout function is used to execute a piece of code after a specified delay (in milliseconds). Here, the delay is set to 1 millisecond.

#### 4: Exploit : So we Can Exploit DOM XSS by injecting alert function to the page using this source and sink :
